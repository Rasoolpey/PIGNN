# DAE System Implementation - Summary

## Completed: DAE System Infrastructure ✅

Successfully implemented a complete DAE (Differential-Algebraic Equation) system following the ANDES framework architecture.

### Key Achievements

1. **Created `RMS_Analysis/dae_system.py`**
   - Full DAE class with differential states (x), algebraic states (y)
   - Equation storage: f (differential RHS), g (algebraic residuals)
   - Jacobian matrices: fx, fy, gx, gy (all sparse)
   - Mass matrix Teye (time constant diagonal matrix)
   - Address management system for component variable allocation

2. **Implemented Augmented Jacobian Builder**
   - Builds Ac matrix for implicit trapezoidal method:
     ```
     Ac = [[ Teye - 0.5*h*fx,  scale*gx^T    ],
           [ -0.5*h*fy^T,      scale*gy       ]]
     ```
   - Proper matrix dimension handling (all transposes correct)
   - Optional scaling for algebraic equations (g_scale parameter)

3. **Residual Calculation**
   - Implements trapezoidal method residuals:
     ```
     q[:n] = Tf*(x - x0) - 0.5*h*(f + f0)   # Differential
     q[n:] = g_scale * h * g                 # Algebraic
     ```

4. **State Management**
   - State save/restore functionality
   - State update with Newton increments
   - Component address allocation and retrieval

### Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Address allocation (12 differential, 82 algebraic variables)
- ✅ Array allocation (x, y, f, g, Tf, Teye, Jacobians)
- ✅ Time constant setting
- ✅ Augmented Jacobian construction (94x94, 9.01% density)
- ✅ Residual calculation
- ✅ State update
- ✅ State save/restore

### Matrix Dimensions (Important!)

For a system with n differential and m algebraic variables:

| Matrix | Dimensions | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| fx     | [n × n]   | ∂f/∂x (differential equations w.r.t. differential states) |
| fy     | [n × m]   | ∂f/∂y (differential equations w.r.t. algebraic states) |
| gx     | [m × n]   | ∂g/∂x (algebraic equations w.r.t. differential states) |
| gy     | [m × m]   | ∂g/∂y (algebraic equations w.r.t. algebraic states) |
| Teye   | [n × n]   | diag(Tf) - time constant diagonal matrix |
| Ac     | [(n+m) × (n+m)] | Augmented Jacobian for Newton solve |

**Important Note**: In the block matrix construction:
- gx needs to be transposed → gx.T [n × m]
- fy needs to be transposed → fy.T [m × n]

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Implicit Trapezoid Solver** (integrator.py)
   - Newton-Raphson loop
   - Sparse linear solver
   - Convergence checking
   - Step size control

2. **Network Algebraic Equations**
   - Power balance at each bus
   - Admittance matrix construction
   - Jacobian blocks (∂g/∂V, ∂g/∂θ)

3. **Generator Model Integration**
   - Compute ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y for generator dynamics
   - Interface with DAE system

4. **Full Integration**
   - Replace RK4 with implicit trapezoid in rms_simulator.py
   - Dynamic bus voltage updates during simulation
