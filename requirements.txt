# Core scientific computing
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Data handling
h5py>=3.6.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0
networkx>=2.6

# Development and utilities
pathlib  # Usually built-in with Python 3.4+

# Optional: For enhanced analytics and comparison (uncomment if needed)
# pandas>=1.3.0  # For CSV/dataframe operations in DIgSILENT comparison
# seaborn>=0.11.0  # For enhanced plotting

# Notes:
# - This requirements file covers the core dependencies identified in the codebase
# - The examples/ folder contains additional dependencies (torch, sklearn) that are not required for the main project
# - Add pandas if you plan to process DIgSILENT CSV exports extensively
# - Python 3.8+ is recommended for full compatibility
