# Physics-Informed Graph Learning for Power Systems (PIGNN)

## 🎯 Research Vision

This repository implements a **physics-informed graph neural network** framework for power system analysis that combines the reliability of established electrical engineering principles with the adaptability of machine learning. Rather than replacing physics with pure ML, we **augment** accurate physics models with minimal learnable terms to capture unmodeled dynamics and improve computational efficiency.

### Key Innovation

> **Hybrid Approach with Learnable Correction Terms**: We start with known mathematical models of electrical grids and add learnable correction terms to capture parasitic components, sub-electromagnetic transients, model mismatch, and time-varying system characteristics while maintaining physical structure and stability guarantees.

## 🚀 Core Objectives

The PIGNN framework aims to:

1. **Preserve Physical Laws**: Maintain energy conservation, power balance, and stability constraints
2. **Enhance Accuracy**: Learn corrections for parasitic effects and modeling uncertainties  
3. **Enable Multi-Fidelity**: Support different levels of detail from planning studies to real-time control
4. **Ensure Interpretability**: Provide physically meaningful learned components
5. **Guarantee Stability**: Maintain system stability through theoretical constraints

## 🏗️ Mathematical Framework

### Grid Representation as Multi-Phase Graph

The system models power grids as three-phase graphs with coupling:

```
G = (G_a, G_b, G_c, E_coupling)
```

**Components:**
- **Nodes (V)**: Generators, loads, buses, storage devices
- **Edges (E)**: Transmission lines, transformers, reactors, switches
- **E_coupling**: Inter-phase coupling edges (transformers, mutual inductances)

### Hybrid Dynamics Formulation

The core innovation lies in the hybrid dynamics equation:

```
dx/dt = F_physics(x, A, u) + G_θ(x, A, u)
        └─────────────┘     └───────────┘
         Known physics      Learnable correction
```

Where:
- **x**: System state vector (voltages, currents, frequencies)
- **A**: Adjacency/incidence matrix (grid topology)
- **u**: Control inputs
- **θ**: Learnable parameters constrained to preserve physical laws

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap
